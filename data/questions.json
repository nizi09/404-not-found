    "question": "You are driving on a road with a 30 mph speed limit and it starts raining heavily. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Keep driving at 30 mph",
      "Drive faster to reach your destination sooner",
      "Slow down if necessary and stay within the speed limit",
      "Brake suddenly"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The speed limit is the maximum speed under ideal conditions. Heavy rain reduces grip and increases stopping distances, so it is safer to reduce your speed while staying within the 30 mph limit. Driving at the same speed or faster could be unsafe, and braking suddenly could cause skidding."

  {
    "category": "road_rules",
    "question": "You are approaching a zebra crossing and a pedestrian is waiting to cross. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Continue if they haven't stepped onto the road",
      "Slow down and be prepared to stop",
      "Sound your horn",
      "Speed up before they cross"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "At a zebra crossing, pedestrians have priority. You must always be ready to stop if someone steps onto the crossing. Continuing or trying to rush past is dangerous, and sounding the horn could scare pedestrians."
  },
  {
    "category": "road_signs",
    "question": "You see a warning sign for a sharp bend ahead. What should you do first?",
    "options": [
      "Accelerate",
      "Slow down",
      "Overtake the vehicle in front",
      "Move into the opposite lane"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Warning signs alert you to potential hazards, like a sharp bend. You should reduce speed before entering the bend to maintain control. Accelerating, overtaking, or moving into the opposite lane is unsafe."
  },
  {
    "category": "safety",
    "question": "You are driving behind another car on a dry road. What is a safe following distance?",
    "options": [
      "1 second behind",
      "2 seconds behind",
      "Right behind them",
      "As close as possible in traffic"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The 2-second rule is the minimum safe distance on a dry road. It gives enough time to stop if the car ahead brakes suddenly. All other options are too close and are unsafe."
  },
  {
    "category": "hazard_perception",
    "question": "You are driving and see a cyclist ahead in your lane. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Overtake immediately",
      "Sound your horn repeatedly",
      "Slow down and give them plenty of space",
      "Drive very close behind them"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Cyclists are vulnerable. You should reduce speed and allow enough room to pass safely. Honking or driving too close can be dangerous, and overtaking immediately may not be safe."
  },
  {
    "category": "road_rules",
    "question": "You approach traffic lights that have just turned amber. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Speed up to get through",
      "Stop if it is safe to do so",
      "Ignore the lights",
      "Turn quickly"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Amber means stop unless it is unsafe to do so (e.g., you're too close to stop safely). Speeding up or ignoring is illegal and unsafe."
  },
  {
    "category": "hazard_perception",
    "question": "You are approaching a junction with poor visibility. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Drive straight out quickly",
      "Slow down and check carefully for traffic",
      "Ignore other vehicles",
      "Close your eyes briefly"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "At a junction with limited visibility, you need to assess potential hazards before entering. Driving straight out or ignoring traffic is unsafe, and closing your eyes is obviously wrong."
  },
  {
    "category": "road_signs",
    "question": "You see signs warning of road works ahead. What should you expect?",
    "options": [
      "No changes to the road",
      "Workers and possible lane closures",
      "Higher speed limits",
      "Empty roads"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Road work signs warn of temporary hazards like lane closures or workers on the road. You should reduce speed and stay alert. The other options are incorrect, and an empty road is unsafe to assume."
  },
  {
    "category": "safety",
    "question": "You hear a siren from an emergency vehicle behind you. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Ignore it",
      "Stop immediately in the middle of the road",
      "Move safely to allow it to pass",
      "Drive faster"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "You must give way to emergency vehicles. This usually means moving to the left or stopping safely. Stopping in the middle, ignoring it, or speeding is dangerous and illegal."
  },
  {
    "category": "road_signs",
    "question": "You see a slippery road warning sign. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Brake sharply",
      "Drive normally without changes",
      "Reduce speed smoothly",
      "Accelerate"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A slippery road sign warns of hazards like ice, wet leaves, or oil. Reducing speed gradually helps maintain control. Braking suddenly or accelerating can cause skidding."
  },

    "category": "road_rules",
    "question": "You are approaching a roundabout. What should you do first?",
    "options": [
      "Speed up",

      "Ignore road markings",
      "Enter quickly"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Vehicles already on the roundabout have priority. You should slow, look, and give way if necessary. Speeding up, ignoring markings, or entering quickly is unsafe."

      "Ignore the parked cars",
      "Overtake everything quickly"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Parked cars can hide hazards like doors opening or pedestrians stepping into the road. Slowing down and staying alert helps you avoid accidents. Driving fast or ignoring them is risky."

    "category": "hazard_perception",
    "question": "You are driving at night and an oncoming vehicle has its full beams on. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Flash your headlights repeatedly",
      "Look directly at their lights",
      "Slow down and look towards the left side of the road",
      "Speed up"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Looking towards the left edge of the road helps avoid being dazzled while maintaining control of your vehicle."

      "When parked legally",
      "When warning others of a hazard or obstruction",
      "When driving in rain",
      "At all junctions"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Hazard lights are used to warn other drivers of a hazard or obstruction. They should not be used while driving normally or parked legally unless warning of a hazard."

    "question": "You are driving behind a large lorry. Why should you increase your following distance?",
    "options": [
      "Lorries always brake faster",
      "Your view ahead is restricted and stopping distance is greater",
      "It is a legal requirement",
      "Lorries accelerate more slowly"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Large vehicles block your view of the road ahead and require more distance to stop safely."
